An app that demonstrates the following:

■ COMPLEX SWIFTUI GESTURES
We will create such a custom button with complex gestures that we can not find in Apple’s stock user interface library.

■ PARALLAX EFFECT AND ANIMATION
By using multiple movements in the opposite direction (parallax effect) we can add depth to this amazing onboarding screen.
